# Heart-Disease-Classification-DecisionTree-RandomForest
I used the Heart Disease dataset to predict heart disease using Decision Tree and Random Forest models, trained on features like heart rate, cholesterol, and age. I evaluated their performance, visualized the decision tree, and identified key features, learning how Random Forest improves accuracy while reducing overfitting.
